# Chess-Clock
Welcome to one of my first projects! This is a simple chess clock made with Arduino on a Adafruit Metro Mini. It allows users to design and wire a
chess clock from scratch. With the code and wiring provided it is a beginner/intermediate project that anyone can make. I hope you enjoy and continue
to improve on your chess journey!

## Parts
* Adafruit Industries Metro Mini 328 - 5V 16MHZ
* 5 keyboard switches (I used glorius lynx switches but any will work)
* LCD 1602 Display module **_with I2C_**
* Assorted Wires

## Inputs
The design includes 5 buttons of which do the following:
* Up Button. The up button is used to increase the time and increment. It also is used to reset the clock during a match while the time is paused.
* Right Button. The right button is used to changed which part of the time is increased (10 min, 1 min, 10 sec, 1 sec)
* Start/Pause Button. This button is used to start the time and change from the setup page into an actual game. It is also used to pause the game during play.
* Player Buttons. These are pressed when the corresponding player makes his move in order to switch turns. They are also used during setup to switch the sides (WB or BW)
